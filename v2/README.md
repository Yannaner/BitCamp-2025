# Quantum Bike Rental Markov Chain Simulation

This project provides a quantum-enhanced bike rental simulation system that models the movement of bikes between rental stations using Markov Chains. It leverages quantum computing via Google's Cirq library to provide more realistic stochastic modeling of bike movements.

## Project Structure

- `backend/` - Python backend with quantum simulation
  - `quantum.py` - Core simulation logic using Cirq
  - `app.py` - Flask API to serve simulation data
  - `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

- `frontend/` - Web interface built with Vite
  - `index.html` - Main page
  - `src/` - JavaScript and CSS source files
  - `package.json` - Node.js dependencies

## Features

- Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain model for bike rental simulation
- Real-time visualization of bike distribution
- Time of day and weather effects on rental patterns
- Comparison between quantum and classical simulation methods
- Interactive map and charts

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- Google Cirq library
- Flask

## Setup

### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Flask server
```bash
python app.py
```

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000

## How It Works

The simulation uses a Markov chain model where each bike station's probability of sending bikes to other stations is determined by:

1. Station distances (closer stations are more likely destinations)
2. Time of day (rush hours increase rental activity)
3. Weather conditions (bad weather decreases rentals)
4. Station capacity constraints

The quantum enhancement leverages quantum random walks to better model the stochastic nature of human decision-making, potentially providing more realistic patterns than classical random processes.

## Quantum vs Classical Mode

The simulation can run in two modes:

- **Quantum Mode**: Uses Cirq to perform quantum random walks, which may exhibit interference patterns that differ from classical random walks.
- **Classical Mode**: Uses traditional Markov chain transitions.

Compare the patterns generated by both modes to see how quantum effects might influence bike rental dynamics.
